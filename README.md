Minigamejam-GhostStories
===========

Unity learning project created during a 48h gamejam session.

Control your drone (thrusterized donut!!!) savely through the maze. But beware! There are evil ghosts in the shadows. Point your light at them to make them stop.

Each player controlls one of up to four thrusters with the left analog stick, thrust is activated with the A (Action) button.
Another player controlls the spot light mounted in the middle of the drone. Pointed at a ghost, it will immediately freeze it as long as it is lit.
